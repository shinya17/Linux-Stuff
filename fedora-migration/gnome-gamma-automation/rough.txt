there should be an option to enable or disable it
automatically leave it to the app or manually set
should be able to set a time/gamma value profile but for now,
we will stick to a min and a max lmao interpolation will be used
and there should be a time interval to update the gamma value
(maybe brightness might be an option in the future)

the question is how to update, systemd service ?

the command is gnome-gamma-tool -y -g #gammavalue


TODO. acktschually, 0.75 seems to be good even in daytime so idk lol
just add to path at this point lol
