- personal files
- most will go to little my archive
- github sync (migrate to gitlab)

- app data
 + mostly i think firefox chrome to restore session
   maybe should do a setting sync for each app probably there is

- system data 
 + bashrc 
PATH="$PATH:/home/shinya/Programming/sdks/flutter/bin/"
PATH="$PATH:/home/shinya/Android/Sdk/platform-tools"
PATH="$PATH:/home/shinya/Linux-Stuff/scriptsToAddToPath"
PATH="$PATH:/home/shinya/Linux-Stuff/fedora-migration/gnome-gamma-automation"

#THIS MUST BE AT THE END OF THE FILE FOR SDKMAN TO WORK!!!
export SDKMAN_DIR="$HOME/.sdkman"
[[ -s "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" ]] && source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"


- app list basically
or maybe all packages because there were codec problems

- system wide configs, the most めんどい because i forgor 
and if i backup everything it will def crash and be a mess,
too much incompatibility
 + extensions list
